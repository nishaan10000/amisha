              <h2>Our Vision</h2>
              <p>
                We envision a future where young people are inspired and empowered to
                understand themselves better, enabling them to transform the world around
                them.
              </p>
              <h2>Our Mission</h2>
              <p>Our mission is to create opportunities and provide support for our members,
                enabling them to become community and professional leaders.</p>

                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p> The Rotaract District 3292 was established in 2008. Prior to that, we were
                  functioning as a part of Rotaract District 3290. After the establishment of
                  District 3292, the Rotaract District, over the years, has been contributing
                  different elements to professionally establish the organization. Hence,
                  after a decade of the establishment of the District, the first Three Year
                  Strategic Plan 2018-2021 was created. With this strategic plan, we had
                  already begun a process of defining ourselves and realigning our priorities
                  for the future. Year One of the Strategic Plan (2018-21) focused on
                  ‘reflection’ as a core part of our planning and action. Year Two emphasized
                  the need to develop the ‘competencies’ of our members and the need to reach
                  out beyond the organization to ‘collaborate’ with others. Finally, during
                  Year Three, we felt the need to work with our ‘values’ to create a new
                  vision for the future. All these strategies have helped us shape the
                  direction of the organization. As we draw closer towards the end of this
                  Strategic Plan, we feel the need to refocus on our priorities to continue on
                  the mission of the organization; but at the same time, establishing new
                  forms of engagement for the future. In creating a new strategic plan for
                  Rotaract District 3292, we take reference from the Rotary International
                  Strategic Plan, Rotary District 3292 Strategic Plan and the Rotaract
                  District 3292 Strategic Priorities Survey 2021 to carve out a niche way
                  forward for the youths in our District. This Strategic Plan also takes into
                  consideration the new policy changes that have been set for Rotaract Clubs
                  by Rotary International, which redefines the make-up and structure of
                  Rotaract Clubs. With these changes in place, we have felt the need to review
                  our existing strategic plan to help shape the future direction of the
                  organisation. We have taken this period to review the existing strategic
                  plan as well as reflect on our experiences of over a decade. In this
                  process, we have interacted and received feedback and suggestions from past
                  and current Rotaract as well as Rotary District leaders. They have been very
                  instrumental in providing a course of action in the past and their
                  suggestions, we believe, will be crucial in shaping the future direction of
                  the organization. Equally important to consider are the views and
                  experiences of rotaractors in general. Hence, as part of collecting these
                  views, we had conducted a nation-wide survey among Rotaractors to gain
                  insights on their experiences of Rotaracting as well as their suggestions
                  for the future outlook of the organization. We have also attempted to review
                  the past activities and achievements of Rotaract in Nepal to provide an
                  understanding of Rotaract engagement in general. All these different
                  perspectives have contributed towards inscribing the new strategic plan of
                  Rotaract District 3292 for 2021-2024.</p>



                  <h2>Strategic Plan</h2>
                  <p>    One of the important measures of reflection regarding the future direction
                    of the organization has been in redefining what Rotaract means for the
                    future. For this, we need to embody who we are as Rotaractors and what we do
                    as Rotaract Clubs. This means we need to define our core values as
                    Rotaractors and streamline our strategic priorities. We believe that the
                    values we instill as Rotaractors not just guide us in conducting ourselves
                    within and outside of the organization, but will also help us perceive the
                    world around us and accommodate ourselves to the evolving times. Likewise,
                    we also need to organise our strategic priorities to address some of the
                    challenges for the future and our contribution in resolving them. Therefore,
                    our revision of the existing strategic plan is to accommodate some of these
                    new demands for the future. We hope that this new strategy will provide a
                    wider perspective to internalise our roles as individuals and institutions
                    to prepare, contribute and eventually position ourselves in the wider world.
                    Our mission is to then create a new culture of youth engagement that
                    transcends beyond the notions of participation and partnership and seeks to
                    envision youths as creators and collaborators and the Rotaract platform as
                    their ground for exploration. We consider the core values and the strategic
                    priorities to be not just facilitative of our plannings for the future, but
                    assist us in being reflective along each step. Moreover, we believe that
                    embracing these values and aligning our strategic priorities will help
                    achieve the vision of Rotaract being a leading youth development
                    organization that enables the development of leaders, creators, and
                    innovators.
                </p>

                <h2>Core Value</h2>
                <p>       Based on the needs of the organization, moving forward, we find it necessary
    to inculcate new values that become the basis of everything that we do.
    These values have been conceived with the understanding that they reflect
    the changing needs of the Rotaract community. They are fundamental to our
    identity, our approaches, and the services we provide towards the community.
    Hence, these values have to be integrated in all of our engagements, within
    and outside of the organization. Simply speaking, these values should become
    the underlying principles in guiding us towards answering the ‘how’
    questions that are fundamental to Rotaract; i.e. how is Rotaracting
    achieved? We have highlighted five core values that should be endorsed by
    the members and clubs within the District
